# hello-world
My first repository and first step to coding life. 

Regretting following a carrier I didn't want. I saw potential in working through coding, so I got interested in studying programming. 

I'm interested in becoming an app developer at first. But with the boom and expansion of the blockchain phenomenom and the introduction of Dapps, I decided that I wanted to learn Solidity as my base programming language. Though, I realize that I need to learn a bit of everything first, so that's why I'm here. 

Soooooo...

HELLO WORLD!!!
